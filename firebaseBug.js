The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided options object is malformed or missing required properties. For example, when initializing Firebase with missing apiKey or projectId parameters, you may receive an error like "Missing or invalid Firebase config parameters".  This is often difficult to trace because it's not immediately apparent from the Firebase docs what is wrong with the config unless you carefully compare it to the required structure. Another instance is when using `onAuthStateChanged` without handling potential errors.
